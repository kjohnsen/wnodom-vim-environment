INTRODUCTION                                        *selective*

Selective is a Vim plugin that improves Vim's text-highlighting capabilities.


REQUIREMENTS                                        *selective-requirements*

This plugin was developed and tested under the GUI version of MacVim 7.3. It
will probably work under other versions of Vim, but has not been yet been
tested on them.


INSTALLATION                                        *selective-installation*

Selective installs like any other global Vim plugin. Just follow the
instructions under |add-global-plugin|.

(If you're reading this via the Vim online help system, then the plugin is
probably already installed.)


USAGE                                               *selective-usage*

Selective enhances the shifted movement keys, like Shift+Up or Shift+Home, to
work more intelligently with wrapped text. Just use Vim as you normally would,
and text selection should be more intuitive.



OPTIONS                                             *selective-options*

The Selective plugin does not yet expose any configuration options, other than
the usual g:loaded_selective variable for controlling whether the plugin
should be loaded or not.


LIMITATIONS                                         *selective-limitations*


There are a few edge-case bugs that haven't yet been squashed, mostly around
the selection of the last character on a line when moving up and down.


AUTHOR                                              *selective-author*

The Selective Vim plugin was written by Bill Odom (http://billodom.com).


LICENSE                                             *selective-license*

The Vim Selective plugin is licensed under the same terms as Vim itself.
