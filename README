- F7/F8 tab switching shortcuts
- disabled colorcolumn as well as fugitive#head stuff that wasn't working for me
- F5 save current file, stall process shortcut

Original README
Welcome to Bill Odom's Vim environment. Here's how to use it:

- Copy (or clone) this directory to ~/.vim (or the equivalent for your OS).

- Create the following symbolic links:

    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc  ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/.gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
