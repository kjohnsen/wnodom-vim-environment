Welcome to Bill Odom's Vim environment. Here's how to use it:

- Copy this directory to ~/.vim (or the equivalent for your OS).

- Create the following symbolic links:

    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc  ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/.gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

Just FYI, all this will be updated to git clone and submodule commands once I
get everything properly converted and pushed to github.
